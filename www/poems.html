		<h1>Poems</h1>
On this page you will find a few poems I've written. Some are serious, but more are lighthearted or humorous.<br/>  
I'm not very experienced at writing poetry, so I'm not promising anything
of quality here :)<br/>

			<span id="S1" class="poem-number">S1 - The hummingbird</span>
			<span class="poem-content">
The city lights diminish one by one.
In bed, my mind slows down, my eyelids fall.
Just one last thought about what must be done
to send this week's installment out to all.

Awoken by the sun's warmth on my face,
I'm in a field, a distant buzz I hear.
While wond'ring if I've ever seen this place,
a hummingbird before me does appear.

She speaks, “You're not alone, your loss is ours”
Behind her, sparrows, doves, and hundreds more.
“But o'er his words, our hearts, death has no powers.”
The birds all nod, then through the blue sky soar.

A beep: the landscape quickly fades away.
A beep beep beep begins another day.

			<span id="S2" class="poem-number">S2 - Final ride</span>
			<span class="poem-content">
The breeze upon my skin and beads of sweat
do cool me from the California sun.
While cycling, feels I've nothing left to fret.
The world is gone; my bike and I are one.

A sudden blow. What's happened? Fade to black.
But fade back in, a strange surreal glow.
The EMTs attempt to bring me back.
From six feet up, I view the scene below.

A brighter light than LA's sun in June
diverts attention from the panicked scene.
The voices dwindle, whisp'ring “it's too soon”.
This light is overwhelmingly serene.

One final glance toward the world I knew
before a new adventure I pursue.

			<span id="S3" class="poem-number">S3 - No bise please</span>
			<span class="poem-content">
My outstretched arm seems obvious to me.
That, coupled with my movement two steps back.
You'd think a handshake's all that there would be,
But no! My cheeks, they each receive a muack.

I cough, I sneeze, a bit of phlegm I spew.
In hopes their fear of sickness will prevail.
But no! “I'm not afraid of kissing you.”
My kleenex filled with snot to no avail.

“Where I'm from, hell, you mustn't let us down.
A double double kiss is how we bise.”
“Hey, fact alert: this ain't your crappy town.
Where I'm from, so you know, it's NONE. So, please.”

Bisoutologue, have you advice for me?
A Yankee who hates bisous, in Paris.

			<span id="S4" class="poem-number">S4 - Meta work</span>
			<span class="poem-content">
Continuous improvement is the trend.
Stability's a notion to rescind.
Employees never cease to recommend
best practices inspired by the wind.

A state of constant reevaluation,
incessant chats of what we should change next,
attempts to finish tasks cut by frustration
and never-ending meetings have me vexed.

Our burn down chart has but a gentle slope.
The backlog though, is growing without bound.
More bodies will absorb the work they hope,
but “how to scale” discussions now abound.

Debates on how to work consume our days,
which doesn't help with our release delays.

Misses Carmen, she came from L.A.
And in Paris her home made to stay.
She adored the croissants
And the sexy accents
But the bises just scared her away.

Carmen bosse sur le code de Libon
et la lib de la boîte Belledonne.
Ils comprennent tous une chose :
faire la bise, même une dose,
et elle part en courant vers Bayonne.

There once was this Yankee called Carmen,
whose manners were somewhat alarmin'.
She was a bit jaded,
all bisous evaded.
“Just handshakes for me!” Not too charmin'.

Dame Carmen elle aime pas faire la bise.
Tu l'obliges et elle entre en mode crise :
“Une poignée de main,
ça ne mange pas de pain.
Si tu fais un bécot je balise”.

			<span id="Birthday" class="poem-number">Birthday absence</span>
			<span class="poem-content">
'Twas today I felt your absence like I hadn't felt before.
On this day you'd always call or send an e-mail, but no more.
I have all the birthday wishes that you sent the last ten years.
As I go through through them today, I feel my eyes fill up with tears.

But I'm glad I have this record. It's stored safely in the cloud.
In your mails you said you missed me, wished the best, said you were proud.
Not just birthday wishes: other mails, from funny to mundane.
It's the history of our communication they contain.

As my eyes browse all the characters you once typed out to me,
I can almost hear your voice, or see you typing every key.
So I thank you for these messages, composed in years past.
Etched in zeros and in ones, they'll be a memory to last.
